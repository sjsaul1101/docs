### Overview

- Each dutch auction lasts 420 blocks, starting at `1 ETH` and ending at  `.001 ETH`
- Exactly **one** mint is allowed per auction (enforced by `auctionMinted[id]`)
- If a full auction passes and no brew is minted, a new brew is generated for the next auction
- Every 10th token is auto-minted to `owner()` for the **next** auction and is **ineligible** for a minter reward (but **can** later be chosen as the random-holder to receive a reward)

### How to Mint

Every 420 blocks, a new brew is available for mint. A dutch auction begins at 1 ETH and decreases linearly with each block until it reaches 0.0001 ETH. 

```solidity
/// start and end price of every auction
uint256 public startPrice = 1 ether;
uint256 public endPrice   = 0.001 ether;
```

Helper functions in the contract are used to track auction progress and price information.

```solidity
/// find out when the current auction ends
function currentAuctionEndBlock();

/// get the current mint price
function getCurrentPrice();
```

Only one brew can be minted per auction. 

```solidity
/// track which auctions have been minted
mapping(uint256 => bool) public auctionMinted;

/// find out if the current auction has been minted
function currentAuctionMinted();
```

Minting results in the current brew being created. 

```solidity
function mint()
```

Every 10th brew minted results in a bonus token.
