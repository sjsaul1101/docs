### Overview 

- Each dutch auction lasts 420 blocks, starting at `1 ETH` and ending at  `.001 ETH`
- Exactly **one** mint is allowed per auction (enforced by `auctionMinted[id]`)
- If a full auction passes and no brew is minted, a new brew is generated for the next auction
- Every 10th token is auto-minted to `owner()` for the **next** auction and is **ineligible** for a minter reward (but **can** later be chosen as the random-holder to receive a reward)
