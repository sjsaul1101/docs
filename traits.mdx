### Layer Organization

On-Chain brews are represented as SVGs that are permenantly stored on the ethereum blockchain.

```solidity
/// each trait contains a name, an svg snippet, and a weight
struct Trait { 
	string name; 
	string svg; 
	uint16 weight;
}

/// traits are assigned to 1 of 4 categories
string[4] public categories = ["Background", "Brew", "Mug", "Top"];

/// categories are stored and tracked on-chain
mapping(string => Trait[]) public traitCategories;
```

Traits can be common, rare, legendary, or epic.
