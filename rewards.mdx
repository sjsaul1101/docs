title: "Rewards"
description: "Most projects run out of steam after the collection mints out and the founders splurge the ETH raised on a Miami penthouse. On-Chain Brews is built different — the reward system is wired to keep both minters and collectors engaged as the collection (and community) grows."

### Overview

- Every time a brew is minted, there’s a chance for a reward
- Rewards are \*\*small \*\*(and frequent) or **large** (and very rare)
- Reward eligibility is determined on-chain with no additional third-party dependencies
- There’s a 256-block window to claim a reward
- When a reward is claimed, ETH is distributed to the minter, the current holder of a random token, and the contract owner
- Rewards are designed to **scale with demand**

### Mint Rewards

Every time a brew is minted, there's a chance a portion of the current contract balance will be distributed as a reward. Rewards aren't just for the minter - they also go to a random holder and the contract owner.

- A **large reward** consists of ~50% of the contract balance and has a 1 in 420 chance of occuring
- A **small reward** consists of ~10% of the contract balance and has a 1 in 10 chance of occuring

The amounts are appoximate - more on that below - and distributed to the minter, random holder, and contract owner according to this chart:

|                  | **Odds** | **Minter** | **Random Holder** | **Contract Owner** |
| :--------------- | :------- | :--------- | :---------------- | :----------------- |
| **Large Reward** | 1 in 420 | ~49%       | ~9%               | ~9%                |
| **Small Reward** | 1 in 10  | ~5%        | ~1%               | ~1%                |

### **Eligibility Delay**

A token’s reward outcome is determined **one block after** it’s minted using `blockhash(mintBlock)`. Until the minting block is sealed, no one can know the outcome. This prevents having to use a third-party service like chainlink for randomization.

### **Claim Window**

Ethereum exposes `blockhash` only for the last 256 blocks; if a claim is attempted after that, `blockhash(mintBlock) == 0` and the token is **not eligible** (effectively creating a soft deadline to claim within ~256 blocks).

- Currently, a bot is set up to auto-process claims on behalf of onchainbrews.eth
- As a fallback, anyone can manually trigger the claim function within the 256-block window.
